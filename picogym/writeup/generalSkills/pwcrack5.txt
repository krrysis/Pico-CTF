Solution:
same concept as previous problem, you just have to get password from a huge list

code for getting password
f hash_pw(pw_str):
    pw_bytes = bytearray()
    pw_bytes.extend(pw_str.encode())
    m = hashlib.md5()
    m.update(pw_bytes)
    return m.digest()

for i in range(len(dic)):
    user_pw_hash = hash_pw(dic[i])
    if(user_pw_hash == correct_pw_hash):
        print(dic[i])


after that
