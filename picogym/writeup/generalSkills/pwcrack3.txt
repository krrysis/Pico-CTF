_____

Description:
Can you crack the password to get the flag? Download the password checker here (https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/24/level3.py) and you'll need the encrypted flag (https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/24/level3.flag.txt.enc)  and the hash(https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/24/level3.hash.bin) in the same directory too. There are 7 potential passwords with 1 being correct. You can find these by examining the password checker script.

Solution:
password is one of the possible password in the list 
i manually tried all the passwords since the list was small, but if the list is large you have to isolate the function that checks the hash u generate with pass to the hash provided, simple modifications.
when u find correct pass just feed it to py prog
